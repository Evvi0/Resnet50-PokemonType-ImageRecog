# PokemonType-ImageRecog
A fun project using image recognition tecniques.

## Summary
This project was an excellent test and use of important convolutional neural network techniques that I have learned. The goal of this project is to correctly predict a pokemon's type (water, fire, pyschic etc.) based on their 128 by 128 by 3 image. Alot of troubleshooting was done, like imagedatagenerator, transfer learning, deeper and more wide networks for modelling, but the model produces poor scores regardless. I beleive this is due to the lack of correlation a lot of pokemon of the same type have. One can be one color and have a complete different shape and size, while another of the same type can be on the opposite side of the spectrum as far as looks go. Although this is true, the model does predict some of them correctly. The project did bear excellent practice and a better understanding of the process of convolutional neural networks.

## Methods
Many technqiues were used to strengthen the model the best I could. Some of which include VGG16, and imagedatagenerator.

## Results
As stated previously, the model produces a very weak score. But it does what it is intended. I hope to uncover other methods to make this model possibly predict a much larger correct classes.

## Test
Here are some correct predictions to see how the model works.
